# SQL DML Commands

## Concepts Covered
- INSERT
- NULL
- IS NULL / IS NOT NULL
- UPDATE
- Temporary Tables
- DELETE
- TRUNCATE
- DROP

---

## INSERT
- Adds new records into a table.
- Can insert all columns or selected columns.

---

## NULL
- Represents a missing or unknown value.
- Compare using `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`, not `=`.

---

## UPDATE
- Modifies existing records.
- Use `WHERE` to update specific rows.
- Without `WHERE`, all rows are updated.

---

## Temporary Table
- Created using `SELECT INTO`.
- Exists only for the current session.

---

## DELETE
- Removes selected rows.
- Without `WHERE`, all rows are deleted.
- Table structure remains.

---

## TRUNCATE
- Removes all rows from a table.
- Faster than `DELETE`.
- Table structure remains.

---

## DROP
- Removes the entire table and its data permanently.

---

## DELETE vs TRUNCATE vs DROP

| Command | Removes Data | Removes Table | WHERE |
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| DELETE | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| TRUNCATE | ✅ (All) | ❌ | ❌ |
| DROP | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Insert records into a table.
- Handle NULL values correctly.
- Update existing records.
- Work with temporary tables.
- Understand the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP.
- # SQL Aggregate Functions - MAX & GROUP BY

## Concepts Covered
- MAX()
- GROUP BY
- Aggregate Functions
- Aliases (`AS`)

---

## MAX()
- Returns the highest value in a column.
- Works with numeric, date, and text columns.

**Examples:**
- Maximum Total Amount
- Latest Sale Date
- Maximum Payment Method (alphabetically)

---

## GROUP BY
- Groups rows with the same values.
- Commonly used with aggregate functions like `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `COUNT()`.

---

## MAX() with GROUP BY
- Find the maximum quantity for each product.
- Find the maximum sales amount for each sale date.

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Find the maximum value in a column using `MAX()`.
- Group records using `GROUP BY`.
- Combine aggregate functions with grouped data.
- Use column aliases to improve query readability.s
- # SQL Aggregate Functions - MIN, SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY, HAVING

## Concepts Covered
- MIN()
- SUM()
- AVG()
- COUNT()
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- ORDER BY

---

## MIN()
- Returns the smallest value in a column.
- Works with numbers, dates, and text.
- Can be combined with `GROUP BY`.

---

## SUM()
- Returns the total of numeric values.
- Commonly used with `GROUP BY`.

---

## AVG()
- Returns the average of numeric values.
- Ignores `NULL` values.

---

## COUNT()
- `COUNT(*)` → Counts all rows.
- `COUNT(column)` → Counts only non-NULL values.
- `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` → Counts unique values.

---

## GROUP BY
- Groups rows having the same values.
- Used with aggregate functions like `MIN()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `COUNT()`.

---

## HAVING
- Filters grouped results.
- Used after `GROUP BY`.
- Supports aggregate functions.

---

## ORDER BY
- Sorts the result set.
- `ASC` → Ascending (default)
- `DESC` → Descending

---

## WHERE vs HAVING

| WHERE | HAVING |
|--------|---------|
| Filters rows | Filters groups |
| Before `GROUP BY` | After `GROUP BY` |
| Cannot use aggregate functions | Can use aggregate functions |

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Find minimum values using `MIN()`.
- Calculate totals with `SUM()`.
- Find averages using `AVG()`.
- Count records using `COUNT()`.
- Group data with `GROUP BY`.
- Filter grouped data using `HAVING`.
- Sort results using `ORDER BY`.
- Understand the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`.
