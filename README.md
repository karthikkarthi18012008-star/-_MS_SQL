# SQL CASE Statement in MS SQL Server

## 📌 Overview
The `CASE` statement is used to apply conditional logic in SQL. It works like an `IF...ELSE` statement in programming languages and helps return different values based on specified conditions.

---

# Concepts Covered

- Simple CASE statement
- CASE with ELSE
- CASE without ELSE
- Using CASE in ORDER BY
- Nested CASE statement
- Categorizing data using CASE
- Custom sorting with CASE

---

# Syntax

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ELSE result3
END
```

---

# Example 1: Categorize Products by Price

### Requirement
Classify products into:

- HIGH
- MEDIUM
- LOW

```sql
SELECT *,
CASE
    WHEN Price >= 500 THEN 'HIGH'
    WHEN Price >= 200 THEN 'MEDIUM'
    ELSE 'LOW'
END AS Price_Category
FROM Products;
```

### Output

| Price | Category |
|--------|----------|
| 650 | HIGH |
| 350 | MEDIUM |
| 120 | LOW |

---

# CASE Without ELSE

If no condition matches, SQL returns **NULL**.

```sql
SELECT *,
CASE
    WHEN Price >= 500 THEN 'HIGH'
    WHEN Price >= 200 THEN 'MEDIUM'
END AS Price_Category
FROM Products;
```

---

# Example 2: Custom Sorting Using CASE

### Requirement

Display categories in this order:

1. Electronics
2. Furniture
3. Accessories

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Products
ORDER BY
CASE
    WHEN Category = 'Electronics' THEN 1
    WHEN Category = 'Furniture' THEN 2
    WHEN Category = 'Accessories' THEN 3
END;
```

---

# Example 3: Nested CASE Statement

### Requirement

Classify products as Premium or Affordable based on both Category and Price.

```sql
SELECT *,
CASE
    WHEN Category = 'Electronics' THEN
        CASE
            WHEN Price >= 300 THEN 'Premium Electronics'
            ELSE 'Affordable Electronics'
        END

    WHEN Category = 'Furniture' THEN
        CASE
            WHEN Price >= 250 THEN 'Premium Furniture'
            ELSE 'Affordable Furniture'
        END

    WHEN Category = 'Accessories' THEN
        CASE
            WHEN Price >= 25 THEN 'Premium Accessories'
            ELSE 'Affordable Accessories'
        END
END AS Product_Group
FROM Products;
```

---

# Key Points

- `CASE` evaluates conditions from top to bottom.
- The first matching condition is returned.
- `ELSE` is optional.
- Without `ELSE`, the result is `NULL` if no condition matches.
- `CASE` can be used in:
  - SELECT
  - ORDER BY
  - WHERE
  - GROUP BY
  - HAVING
  - UPDATE statements

---

# Learning Outcomes

After completing these examples, you will be able to:

- Use `CASE` to implement conditional logic.
- Categorize records dynamically.
- Create custom sorting orders.
- Write nested `CASE` statements.
- Improve query readability without complex logic.

# SQL Table Creation, Data Insertion & Data Copying (MS SQL Server)

## 📌 Overview

This module introduces the fundamental SQL operations required to create databases and tables, insert records, understand datatype behavior, and copy data between tables. These commands form the foundation of database management in Microsoft SQL Server.

---

## Concepts Covered

- Creating a database
- Creating a table
- Table columns and datatypes
- Inserting single and multiple records
- Inserting values into selected columns
- Viewing table structure
- Understanding `TINYINT` datatype
- Implicit datatype conversion
- Copying tables
- Copying table structure only
- Copying table structure with data

---

## Key Learnings

### Database Creation
A database acts as a container that stores related tables, views, procedures, and other database objects.

### Table Creation
A table is created by defining column names and assigning appropriate datatypes to each column.

### Data Insertion
Data can be inserted:
- One record at a time
- Multiple records in a single statement
- Into all columns
- Into only selected columns

If values are provided only for selected columns, the remaining columns contain `NULL` (unless default values or constraints are defined).

### Viewing Table Information
SQL Server provides system views that allow developers to inspect a table's structure, including column names, datatypes, nullability, and other metadata.

### Datatype Validation
Every column accepts only values compatible with its datatype.

For example:
- `TINYINT` stores values from **0 to 255**.
- Values outside this range generate an error.
- SQL Server can automatically convert compatible values between datatypes when possible (implicit conversion).

### Copying Tables
SQL Server allows copying:
- The complete table (structure and data)
- Only selected columns
- Only the table structure without records
- Data into an already existing table

These techniques are commonly used for backups, testing, reporting, and data migration.

---

## Important Points

- Always choose appropriate datatypes for each column.
- Specify column names while inserting data whenever possible.
- Ensure inserted values match the datatype of each column.
- Use table-copying techniques to create backups or temporary working tables.
- Copying only the table structure is useful when preparing empty tables for future data.

---

## Applications

These concepts are widely used in:
- Student Management Systems
- Employee Databases
- Sales Management Systems
- Inventory Management
- Data Migration
- Database Backup and Recovery
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes

---

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Create databases and tables in MS SQL Server.
- Design tables using suitable datatypes.
- Insert single and multiple records efficiently.
- Insert data into specific columns.
- Understand datatype restrictions and conversions.
- View table metadata.
- Copy existing tables with or without data.
- Create empty tables using existing table structures.

---

## Conclusion

Table creation, data insertion, and table copying are among the most fundamental SQL operations. A solid understanding of these concepts helps build efficient, reliable, and scalable databases while preparing you for more advanced topics such as constraints, joins, indexing, stored procedures, and database optimization.

# Conclusion

The `CASE` statement is one of the most useful SQL features for applying business rules directly within queries. It simplifies conditional operations, data categorization, and custom sorting without modifying the original table.
